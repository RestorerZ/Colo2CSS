Converting color schemes of the program Vim editor into ready-made CSS files.


==============================================================================
1. Overview of the plugin			*overview-colo2css*

This plugin is designed to convert the current color scheme of the program
Vim Editor into a ready-made Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) file. The CSS files
prepared by this plugin meet the requirements CSS Validation Service
(https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and can be used to connect to an HTML
or XHTML document (web page).

The plugin can be used both for converting only the current color scheme, and
for batch processing of several files of color schemes of the Vim editor.

When converting a color scheme, you can set the desired background — dark or
light. It is also possible to specify the directory where the finished CSS
files will be written.

This plugin requires a program Vim version 8.2 or older to work. To convert
color schemes, a variant of the program with support for a graphical user
interface (GUI) is used.

==============================================================================

==============================================================================
3. Using the plugin				*using-colo2css*

After installing this plugin as described in the previous paragraph, the
module is ready for use. To run it, you need to type the command in the
command line of the Vim editor

>
	TOcss
<

After pressing the <ENTER> key, a CSS file for the current color scheme will
be created in the "Colo2CSS" subdirectory of the user's home directory.

To use this plugin in extended mode, you must specify the arguments supported
by this command. The command arguments are separated by a space.

Command arguments:

	:TOcss [[ALL | list_files] [dark | light] [outdir]] ~

where
 ALL		    Convert all color scheme files located in the "color"
		    subdirectory and located in the directories specified in
		    the 'runtimepath' and 'packpath' parameter.
 list_files	    Is a list of color scheme files that you want to convert
		    to CSS files. If more than one file is specified, the
		    files are separated by a comma without spaces. Commas and
		    spaces are not allowed in the file names.
 dark or light	    Background used for color schemes when they are loaded
		    into the Vim editor and then converted.
 outdir		    Directory for ready-made CSS files. Set as an absolute
		    route. The directory must exist and be writable. By
		    default, the automatically created "Colo2CSS" subdirectory
		    in the user's directory is used.

Examples:

>
	TOcss light
<

The current color scheme will be converted using a light background. The
result will be saved to the ~/Colo2CSS directory (if this directory is
missing, it will be created automatically in the user's home directory).

>
	TOcss ALL d:\project\myhomepage\css
<

All color scheme files will be converted, and the finished CSS files will be
saved to the "css" directory located along route d:\project\myhomepage. The
ALL argument is specified only in uppercase letters. The directory must
already exist and be writable. If this directory does not exist, the result
will be saved in the directory C:\Users\<username>\Colo2CSS.

>
	TOcss darkblue.vim,mustang,PaperColor.vim,desert dark e:\colorscheme
<

The conversion of the specified files with the dark background enabled will be
performed, and the result will be saved in "e:\colorscheme". The names of the
color scheme files can be specified with or without the ".vim" extension.
Files are separated from each other by a comma, spaces and commas in the file
names are not allowed. There should be no space between the file name and the
comma symbol.
